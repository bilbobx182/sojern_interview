## Repo Structure
```
-/ tracking_api
    --/requirements.txt
-/ util_cli
-/ tests
```

## Code
The code was run and validated against version Python 3.8.2
If you don't have a compatible you can use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

### Utils
Question 1 of the assignment:
Utils uses all default python modules
```
python3 util_cli/app.py --version1 2.0 --version2 1.0
1
```

### Tracking API
Question 3 of the assignment
run `pip3 install -r tracking_api/requirements.txt` before trying to execute the API.
Can be run by the following command. `python3 tracking_api/app.py `
Uses uvicorn / FASTAPI.
Workers, host, and port are configured by environment variables. `sojernworkers`,`sojernport`,`sojernhost` respectively.

Ideally if scale is a concern :
- Put the API behind a load balancer to distribute work.
- We would scale horizontally for this kind of API.
- Requirements on how frequently the file contents changes would help define cache strategy.
- We would also use an external cache rather than application lru cache.

#### Example startup
```

## Tests
To run tests, run the following command from the top level directory
Currently we have typical unit tests for the utils, and some integration for the API.

`python3 -m unittest discover -v`
An example is
```
(venv) âžœ  sojern python3 -m unittest discover -v
